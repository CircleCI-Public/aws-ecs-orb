# Usage Examples

Easily author and add [Usage Examples](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author/#providing-usage-examples-of-orbs) to the `src/examples` directory.

Each _YAML_ file within this directory will be treated as an orb usage example, with a name which matches its filename.

View the included _[example.yml](./example.yml)_ example.

Usage examples should contain clear use-case based example configurations for using the orb.
