Description: Deploy a service into an ECS cluster behind a public load balancer.
Parameters:
  StackName:
    Type: String
    Default: production
    Description: The name of the parent cluster stack that you created. Necessary

    Default: nginx
    Description: A name for the service
  FamilyName:
    Type: String
    Default: nginx
    Description: A name for the task definition family
  ImageUrl:
    Type: String
    Default: nginx
    Description: The url of a docker image that contains the application process that
                 will handle the traffic for this service
  ContainerPort:
    Type: Number
    Default: 80
    Description: What port number the application inside the docker container is binding to
  TaskCpu:
    Type: Number
    Default: 256
    Description: How much CPU to define for the task. 1024 is 1 CPU
  TaskMemory:
    Type: Number
    Default: 512
    Description: How much memory in megabytes to define for the container
  Path:
    Type: String
    Default: "*"
    Description: A path on the public load balancer that this service
                 should be connected to. Use * to send all load balancer
                 traffic to this service.
  Priority:
    Type: Number
    Default: 1
    Description: The priority for the routing rule added to the load balancer.
                 This only applies if your have multiple services which have been
                 assigned to different paths on the load balancer.
  DesiredCount:
    Type: Number
    Default: 2
    Description: How many copies of the service task to run
  Role:
    Type: String
    Default: ""
    Description: (Optional) An IAM role to give the service's containers if the code within needs to
