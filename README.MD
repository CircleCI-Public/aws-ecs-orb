A CircleCI Orb to simplify deployments to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). It supports EC2 and Fargate launch type deployments.

CircleCI orbs registry page: https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/aws-ecs

## Features

This orb allows convenient updating of ECS services when only the Docker
image name/tag and/or environment variables in a service's container definitions need to be updated.
A sample project that demonstrates using the orb is available on this GitHub repository branch: https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-aws-ecs-ecr/tree/simple_orb_demo

### Jobs

You can reference the following Jobs provided by this orb from a 2.1 Workflows configuration stanza.

- [**deploy-service-update**](#deploy-service-update) - Update an ECS service.
- [**update-task-definition**](#update-task-definition) - Update an ECS task definition without modifying a service.

#### deploy-service-update

##### Requirements
- `python` should be available in `PATH`. Supported versions are Python 2 version 2.7.1 and above and Python 3 version 3.4.9 and above.
- The `aws` CLI should be available in `PATH`. Otherwise, `pip` is required to be available as the job will then attempt to install `aws` via `pip`. The default profile of `aws` will be used.
- `bash` to be present in `/bin/bash`. Otherwise, `/bin/sh` will be used, but the orb has not been tested for compatibility with other shells.

### Commands
You may use the following commands provided by this orb directly from your own job.

- [**update-service**](#update-service) - Registers a task definition for the given ECS service and updates the service to use it. The new task definition is based on the last task definition, except with the Docker image/tag names and environment variables of the containers updated according to this command's parameters. Optionally polls the status of the deployment until the created task definition  has reached its desired running task count and is the only one deployed for the service.

- [**verify-revision-is-deployed**](#verify-revision-is-deployed) - Polls the service's deployment status at intervals until the given task definition is the only one deployed for the service, and the task definition's running task count matches the desired count.

- [**update-task-definition**](#update-task-definition) - Updates a task definition without modifying a serivce. Useful for updating single run tasks.

## Permissions

You will need to add an IAM policy to your CircleCI IAM user to allow the following permissions:

| Permission |
| ---- |
| `ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition` |
| `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` |
| `ecs:UpdateService` |
| `iam:PassRole` |

- `iam:PassRole` is required to (re)set any container roles or task execution roles during the deployment that you have already configured via the UI. These are resource-based so you can whitelist which roles your CircleCI IAM role can set, if desired.
