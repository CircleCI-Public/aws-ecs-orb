## Orb Quick Start Guide
1.Use CircleCI version 2.1 at the top of your .circleci/config.yml file.
```yaml
version: 2.1
```
If you do not already have Pipelines enabled, you'll need to go to Project Settings -> Advanced Settings and turn it on.

2.Add the orbs stanza below your version, invoking the orb:
```yaml
orbs:
  aws-ecs: circleci/aws-ecs@0.0.18
```

3.Use aws-ecs elements in your existing workflows and jobs.

## Features

This orb allows convenient updating of ECS services when only the Docker
image name/tag and/or environment variables in a service's container definitions need to be updated.
A sample project that demonstrates using the orb is available on this GitHub repository branch: https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-aws-ecs-ecr

## Usage

See the [orb registry listing](http://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/aws-ecs) for usage guidelines.

## Requirements
- `python` should be available in `PATH`. Supported versions are Python 2 version 2.7.1 and above and Python 3 version 3.4.9 and above.
- The `aws` CLI should be available in `PATH`. Otherwise, `pip` is required to be available as the job will then attempt to install `aws` via `pip`. The default profile of `aws` will be used.
- `bash` to be present in `/bin/bash`. Otherwise, `/bin/sh` will be used, but the orb has not been tested for compatibility with other shells.

## Example

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@0.1.4
  aws-ecs: circleci/aws-ecs@0.0.15

jobs:
  update-tag:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.7.1
    steps:
      - aws-cli/install
      - aws-cli/configure:
          aws-access-key-id: "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
          aws-region: "$AWS_REGION"
      - aws-ecs/update-service:
          family: "${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service"
          cluster-name: "${MY_APP_PREFIX}-cluster"
          container-image-name-updates: "container=${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service,tag=stable"
workflows:
  deploy:
    jobs:
      - update-tag
```
